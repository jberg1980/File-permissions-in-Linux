<h1>File permissions in Linux</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The cybersecurity analyst needed to change/update the file permissions of certain files and directories in the projects directory of the research team.directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure. To complete this task, I performed the following tasks:

<h2>Summary </h2>
I changed multiple permissions to match the level of authorization my organization wanted for
files and directories in the projects directory. First step in this was using ls -l and ls -la to
check the permissions for the directory. This informed my decisions in the following steps. I
then used the chmod command multiple times to change the permissions on files and
directories.

<br />
I now have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to
<br />
●	examine file and directory permissions,<br />
●	change permissions on files, and<br />
●	change permissions on directories.
